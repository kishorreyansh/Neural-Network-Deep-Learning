# Write a python program for the following:
# – Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, 
# reverse the resultant string and print it.
# Sample input: python
# Sample output: ntyp

# str = input("Enter the input string:")

# Delete at least 2 characters from the given string

# if len(str) >= 2:
#     str = str[:-2]
# else:
#     str = str[:-1]

# Reverse the resultant string
    
# print(str[::-1])


# – Take two numbers from user and perform at least 4 arithmetic operations on them.

a = int(input("Enter the First Number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the Second Number: "))

# Addition
print(a + b) 
# Subtraction
print(a - b)
# Multiplication
print(a * b) 
# Division
print(a / b)
